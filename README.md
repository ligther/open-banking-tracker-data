This repository holds all the providers displayed in the tracker. 

[Open Banking Tracker](https://www.openbankingtracker.com/) shows whether large institutions, such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Citi, and many more, have the correct infrastructure in place to be adequately prepared for the upcoming change in the regulatory environment as we will be tracking over 30 data points per organization (Sandboxes, AIS, PIS, APIs, Data breaches, iOS, and Android usage, etc.). In regards to PSD2 and Open Banking, registered financial institutions are required to have developer sandboxes (area for developers to test their programs) and relevant APIs in place to promote transparency and freedom of data.

Our goal, through this project, is to bring more transparency throughout the industry as well as empower developers and customers to choose the right partner to help support their growth. We will encourage that by sharing insights and reports in the future based on the analytics we generate.
